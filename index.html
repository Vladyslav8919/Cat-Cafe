      <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
      <h3>How we started?</h3>
      <p>
        The cafe opened in May 2020. Since then, we have welcomed an average of
        over 35,000 visitors during a normal year. Cat Cafe is primarily
        volunteer-run, who oversee the business affairs, cat care and daily
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also operate as a resource center for animal rescuers, providing
        educational workshops and holding space for newly-rescued cats and we
        began conducting services in December 2021.
      </p>

      <h3>Our mission expands</h3>
      <p>
        During the COVID pandemic, we turned our attention to growing our foster
        program. We now house around 200 cats in foster homes at any given time,
        massively increasing our life-saving capacity through the generosity of
        our community of cat lovers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, we began a low-cost medical clinic, providing vaccinations,
        exams, and other services to recent rescues. In 2021 our spay/neuter
        clinic started offering low-cost options to rescuers and low-income
        community members.
      </p>

        data-src="img/img-5.jpg"
        alt="A man strokes a cat in the Cat cafe,"
      />

      <h3>Expanding outreach out for evolving needs</h3>
      <p>
        As our focus broadens to provide more access to low-cost veterinary care
        for both rescuers and low-income pet owners, we’re able to help even
        more animals stay with their loving families, on their journey to
        adoptive homes, or continue their lives as healthier, happier community
        cats.
      </p>

      <h3>Our reach</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2020, we have rescued over 700 cats and more than 100 other
        animals including dogs, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, mice and a chicken.
        Over 400 cats have been placed in permanent adoptive homes.
      </p>

      <h3>Adopting a hypoallergenic cat</h3>
      <p>
        Some cats may affect you differently than others, but it’s unlikely that
        it has to do with the fur color or type of coat. There are things you
        can do to minimize your reaction, like using cat wipes to reduce dander
        or not letting the cat on the bed.

          <h3 class="esa-heading">Adopting a cat as an ESA</h3>
          <p>
            Animals can provide incredible emotional support, however, we ask
            you to deeply consider all the reasons that you want to adopt a cat.
            While the act of caring for another living being can be healing, it
            can also produce its own anxieties.
          </p>
          <h3>Adopting young kittens</h3>
          <p>
            Young kittens still need several vet visits and adoptions are not
            considered final until they complete vaccinations and are
            spayed/neutered.
          </p>
          <h3>Adopting with a roommate</h3>
          <p>
            Please make sure that you are fully prepared for all of the
            responsibilities involved in pet ownership before applying. Consult
            a professional and consider fostering first to make sure caretaking
            is a helpful part of your healthy lifestyle.

        <h3>What is the Cat Cafe?</h3>
        <p>
          We are a non-profit animal rescue working to reduce animal
          homelessness through adoption, education, and outreach run by the
          animal rescue group.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you serve food and drinks?</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t have any human snacks at this time, but we make up for that
          with treats for the cats.
        </p>
        <h3>Cab I foster cats from the Cafe?</h3>
        <p>
          The cats at the cafe are not available for fostering as cafe residents
          have already graduated from our foster program. We do, however, have
          many other lovely cats and kittens looking for temporary homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are always happy to expand our foster network – please submit an
          application to get started. Learn more about our foster program here.
